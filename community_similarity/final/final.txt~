INTRO:

We are going to write a program that predicts per capita crime.   The idea
is that a user can enter in numerical information about a community, and
we can prodvide a prediction about their per capital crime rate. 

DETAILS:

So, here is what we will do.  


1) I have a data set that contains a collection of communities 
and their crimate rates ("communities.data") Each line of the file
describes one community. The amount of data per community is insane.
Check out communities.names for a complete description. The first attribute
is the crime rate.  The second and the third attributes are often unknown
( represented with a question mark )



   Each line contains 16 peices
of information.    I have no idea what most of that information is.  They
wouldn't tell me.  All they would tell me is that the last symbol in the line
is a + ( if the person paid back the loan ) or a - ( if they did not pay off theloan).


All I could find about the rest of the attributes is:

    A1:	b, a, z
    A2:	continuous.
    A3:	continuous.
    A4:	u, y, l, t, z
    A5:	g, p, gg, z
    A6:	c, d, cc, i, j, k, m, r, q, w, x, e, aa, ff, z
    A7:	v, h, bb, j, n, z, dd, ff, o, z
    A8:	continuous.
    A9:	t, f, z
    A10:	t, f, z
    A11:	continuous.
    A12:	t, f, z
    A13:	g, p, s, z
    A14:	continuous.
    A15:	continuous.
    A16: +,-         (class attribute)




2) When the program starts, read the file crx.csv into a data base.  Your 
data base should be an array of structures. 


3) When someone wants to apply for credit, we collect all the information 
about them that we can.  Unfortunately, this will be a bit annoying for our
user ( For A1, is the applicant b, a, or z? For A4, is the applicant u,u
l,t, or z).  For the continuous attributes, please tell the user the
historical min, max, and standard deviation of that attribute. 

4) Then search the array for the example that best matches the current 
applicant.
