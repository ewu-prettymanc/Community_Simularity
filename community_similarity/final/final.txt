INTRO:

We are going to write a program that predicts per capita crime.   The idea
is that a user can enter in numerical information about a community, and
we can prodvide a prediction about their per capital crime rate. 

DETAILS:

So, here is what we will do.  


1) I have a data set that contains a collection of communities 
and their crimate rates ("communities.data") Each line of the file
describes one community. The amount of data per community is insane.
Check out communities.names for a complete description. If a
value is unkown, it is represented with a question mark.


2) When the program starts, read the data file into a data base.  Your 
data base should be an array of structures. 


3) Then ask the user to enter in the data for the community they are worried
about.  Allow them to enter ? if they don't know.  Please be nice to the
user and display helpful questions.  

Then find and print the crime rate, the name, and closeness of the community
in our data base that is closest to the community the user entered.
When computing closeness, we will use the geometric distance between the
numeric values of the communities ( exlcuding the attributes: state,
county, community, and fold ).  

4) After one print is done, ask the user if they would like another.

5) Misc:  
   a) use a makefile, 2 .h files, 3.cpp files ( min )
   b) must NO STATIC arrays in the structure and the array of structures
      must also be dynamic
   c) all malloc'd memory must be free'd
   d) a design document called DESGIN.txt
   e) good style
   f) NO LATE DAYS ALLOWED ON THIS ONE.  IF YOU ARE LATE, YOU GET A ZERO.
